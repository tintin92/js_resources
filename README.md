### 4. Data Structures: Objects and Arrays
Numbers, Booleans, and strings are the atoms that data structures are built from. 
__Objects__ and __Arrays__ are more complex and they are used to build more complex structures. 

__Objects__ allow us to group values, including other objects, together. 

__Arrays__ allow us to group values, including other arrays, together. JS provides a this data type specifically for storing sequences of values. Is written as a list of values between square brackets, separated by commas.
